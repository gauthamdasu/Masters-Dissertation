As part of my Masters course a dissertation work titled "Reversible watermarking for Medical Images" has been carried.
Different techniques in reversible watermarking like bit substitution, least significant bit based techniques and others 
are used in the dissertation.
Also a comparitive study of the Frequency based and Spatial domain based techniques is also done in this field of watermarking of
the medical images.


The repository has the codes related to the implementation of papers used in the dissertation work.
